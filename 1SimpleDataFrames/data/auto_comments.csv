However, the effective day was about 5 days prior to that which means it is still in the 90 day quoted period. Instead of Integrity being understanding and just fixing the error. They made me jump through a bunch of hoops and wait about 2 and a half weeks before finally getting an answer. They weren't able to just adjust the quote for some reason, so they had me submit it and pay the amount that the original app showed and then they credited the account on there end. It was very nice that they ended up coming through for me, however, I feel that it was way more work and confusion than there needed to be.",Service

3901216,Producer,,,Life,8,Detractor,Somewhat Agree,I haven't done a lot with Grange but once reason I put what I did is because I was selling the child policy and didn't realize that I used the old forms.  I wish someone would have called me right away instead of sending the forms back.  Also the form didn't specify that a signature is required at age 15 in SC and then the juvenile section needed to be completed on the agent form even though he was over 15.  Took a month to get done and I think proper guidance from the beginning would have made things easier.  I blame myself for not having the update enrollment form.,

4501197,Principal,Personal Lines,,,8,Promoter,Agree,"I actively work to place clients with Grange when the required coverage is available and priced competitively.   On risks that meet the underwriting guidelines, Grange is indeed pretty easy to work with. On the other hand, risks that do not fit neatly within the underwriting guidelines are more difficult.  Since we actively solicit more affluent type package business (not mass market price driven shop every year clients), and as you well know, these types of customers have risk issues that often do not fit neatly in to the underwriting requirements / guidelines and require an underwriting exception. Our philosophy is that an account that is an exception as new business will most likely always be an exception and we would prefer not make exceptions on new business unless it is easily justified. With Grange, we routinely run in to issues of eligibility, coverage gap and / or pricing issues on some part of the account that interferes with us from closing the sale.",Process

1040,Customer Service Representative (CSR),,Commercial Lines,,8,Neutral,Strongly Disagree,It is too complicated to explain to customers why their auto policy premium goes up when they delete a vehicle (Ratio) and why the premium increases if they change the mailing address.  We have seen some auto premiums increase $400.00 because they went from a PO Box to a street address.,
1040,Customer Service Representative (CSR),Personal Lines,,,5,Promoter,Strongly Disagree,"Because it is very hard to do business with a company that increases a premium because, for example, you change a mailing address on an auto policy.",

Recently 2 of our clints had claims, the adjustors went out entered the cost of their damages in their computer and sent a check, the estimates were considerably less than the actual cost of repairs, and the adjustors would never call them back.  By the time the insured's contacted me, they were very upset, Andy Connell the claims supervisor stepped in and really took care of things, but insured's should not have to battle tohave their homes repaired.  These were legitimate uncontrollable claims.  I tried to email the different adjustors, and they didn't e mail me back.  I tried calling them and they did not answer and their mailboxes were full.  So you need to fix our underwriter and you need to fix your claims adjustors.",

We have to go through too many channels to get reinstatement billing Issues resolved if an insured has a non payment of premium.  2. If an insured is on EFT and has a new checking account with the ""funds"" in their bank, If comes back as disputed funds. (I don't have this issue with other carriers) 3. If there is a problem with a home inspection, We are not given enough time to resolve the situation. Underwriting cancels and sends the premium back to the insured. We then have to come back to the insured and ask to forward the premium back to us so when we reinstate the policy. Too many extra steps.",

2011,Producer,Personal Lines,,,10,Neutral,Agree,"2 things 1.  Rates are much higher than other companies.   2.  Your minimum deductible for new homes are too high.  The client prefers a lower deductible than 2500.  3.  The errors I get in my rating system, never quotes Grange.

4716,Principal,Personal Lines,,,9,Promoter,Somewhat Agree,the only reason I don't strongly agree are the quirky things now that happen as you get close to the upload button for home and auto apps. There are error messages that are supposed to be pretty much ignored and others that are critical. The trick is trying to determine which ones are important. I have to call just about every time. The system cries wolf all the time and you don't know whether to believe it.,

I also enjoy working with your technology that simplifies the ease of doing business with Grange.

I've found it to be a bit restrictive. I had a policy cancel due some vines. I'd also do something with auto rates for preferred customer and also with people that have kids. Grange is often 30% more and I'd think the company would want to compete for relatively low risk business like that.",

While most companies have a $1000 min. deductible option and have the freedom to choose a higher deductible, Grange has a set min. deductible based on if the customer is mono-line or has a loss. I don't agree with that and it makes it a hard sale if the Grange is competitive with another carrier and they maybe had one loss. The other company can offer the $1000 deductible, where if the home is anywhere up to $500k the minimum deductible would be $1500. While I see where you are coming from with this from a loss standpoint. I don't agree that there should be a set deductible for something and they should be punished for having a loss/mono-line policy. They are already not getting the multi-policy discount.",Process

I don't even quote it that way just because I think it is crazy absurd - where did the trust in the agent go?  Making more work for all.  I will always recommend them yet I am not happy with even offering (which we will not) stripped down policies - Grange has always been a first class company and I feel like if they just want price they can get it anywhere.  Claims are overwhelmed - we have EXCELLENT adjusters - the cuts they have done ARE making it hard for me to be comfortable that they will receive personal attention in the event of a claim.   NOT looking at water claims anymore?  Wow - they need to keep the personal touch when a claim is turned in and not just told to get 3 estimates - absurd and very non-caring.  Customers WANT to see an adjuster - just doesn't make sense.  Cutting expenses in claims is not working.  Please address this.,

1001028,Principal,,Commercial Lines,,6,Neutral,Somewhat Disagree,"First, we have a direct contract with  Grange and so have a vested interest in growing our book with you. The problem is your personal lines rates are out of kilter with the competition and you have no 12 month auto policy.  Also, it seems on C&T cases if the customer does not  have a halo and walk 12 inches off the ground, you will not consider them.  Just wrote a new venture Landscaper/Lawn Maintenance case with Lib Mut. We would  have preferred to place this case with Grange, however the  Grange Underwriter had a problem with some of the operations the guy was  planning to be involved with and rejected  the case, even after the customer decided to discontinue the problem operations.  Lib Mut, based on same info had no problem and we wrote the policy today.",

The underwriting philosophy was inconsistent with some of our other carriers, service was spotty, and the attitude of some home office CSRs left something to be desired.  That was then.  Not sure what changes have been made, but they're all for the better.  Underwriting is now much more open and agreeable, service has improved considerably, and the experience is generally far, I mean far, more pleasant than it was years ago.  I try to put business with Grange as often as I can, for the reasons above.  Thanks!",
